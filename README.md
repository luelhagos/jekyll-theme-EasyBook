# My Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built using the Jekyll theme EasyBook and integrated with BootstrapMade to create a seamless, elegant experience for showcasing my resume, projects, and personal blog.

## Features of My Website

- **Blog**: I share my thoughts, tutorials, and interesting topics that I encounter along my journey.
- **Resume & Portfolio**: Thanks to the integration with BootstrapMade, you can view my professional resume and projects, all presented in a clean, modern layout.
- **Pagination**: Browsing my blog posts is intuitive and smooth, allowing easy access to older content.
- **Table of Contents (TOC)**: TOCs are available on longer posts, making navigation easier.
- **Comments**: Engage with my posts by leaving comments through Disqus.
- **Profile**: A snapshot of who I am, complete with links to my social profiles.
